To get the project up and running on your local computer,
you have two options.

1. Run in a development mode

-   open up a terminal in root directory
-   cd into the frontend directory
-   run "npm i"
-   run "npm run dev"
-   open up a separate terminal in the root directory
-   cd into backend directory
-   run "npm i"
-   run "npm run dev"
-   navigate to http://localhost:5173/ and you should see the app!

2. Run in production mode (Preferred Way)

-   open up a terminal in the root directory.
-   cd into the frontend directory.
-   run npm i
-   run "npm run build"
-   when that is finished, cd back into the root directory,
    and then into the backend directory.
-   run npm i
-   run "npm run build"
-   when that is finished, run "npm run start"
-   you should see some messages pop up about it starting.
-   Navigate to http://localhost:3000 and you should see the app!
